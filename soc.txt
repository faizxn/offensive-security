
#> Malware analysis is the process of understanding the behavior and purpose of a suspicious file or URL. 
	The output of the analysis aids in the detection and mitigation of the potential threat.


 #> IoC collects threat information using Threat Intelligence feeds.

			Cisco Telous
			Google Safe Browsing
			Minemeld Palo Alto				
						 
Threat Intelligence feeds are continuous data streams filled with threat information 
IoC information form Threat Threat -> SIEM (3rd party integration support) can take threat intel data inputs 

local enviroment with co-relate kore..  




#> SSL/TLS (443) is a standard security protocol that ensures the confidentiality and integrity of data while in transit. 
		It encrypts the data flow between the web browser and web server. 
		SSL used symmetric encryption to encrypt data between browser and web server. 
			
 #> Certificate Signing Request or (CSR) is encoded information that contains the applicant's information such as a common name
		a name of an organization.. email address.. city.. state and country. This encoded information is used by certifying authority 
		(CA) to issue an SSL certificate to the applicant.. 
		
	
 #> PSK (Pre Shared Key) encryption algorithms refer to the symmetric key used to encrypt data between browser and web server.
		the most commonly used algorithms are AES or Blowfish
		
 

 #> Incident - An unexpected occurance that requires immediate response and actions
	Event -  Any activity is called event
	Log -  Log file is a file that records events


 #> Three main components of SOC (Security Operation Center):

	- people
		+ SOC manager (a leader is always needed,  lead and manage the whole security operation center)
		+ Analyst (responsible for performing all the analysis, investigation, and reporting)
		+ SOC Engineer | Operator 
		
	- process
		+ Incident triage process
		+ Incident reporting process
		+ Incident analysis process
		+ Incident closure process
		+ Post incident activities process
		+ Vulnerability discovery process
		+ Vulnerability remediation and tracking

	- technology
		+ SIEM
		+ EDR/XDR
		+ IPS/IDS
		+ Cyber Threat Intelligence Feeds and Databases
		+ Vulnerability scanners
		
		
		
 #> 6 Incident Response Plan:
 
		+ Preparation	- with traige exercise
		+ indentify		- size and scope of the incidents
		+ Contain		- isolate the compromise devices
		+ Eradicate		- threat
		+ Recover		- store to normal service
		+ Learn  		- lessons from incident and improve future response
		
		
		
		Proactive Capabilities
			Preparation - Design, development, training, and implementation of enterprise-wide IR plan
						  Creating communication guidelines to enable seamless communication during and after an incident.
						  
			Detection	- The objective of this phase is to monitor networks and systems to detect, alert, and report on potential security incidents.
						  Adopt cyber threat intelligence (CTI) capabilities to develop a comprehensive cyber monitoring program and to support 
						  ongoing monitoring and detection

			Analysis	- Gathering information and then prioritizing individual incidents and steps for a response.
						  Forensic preservation and analysis of data to determine the extent and impact of the incident.
						
						  During the event of an incident, the incident response team should focus on three areas:
							 + Endpoint Analysis
							 + Binary Analysis
							 + Enterprise Hunting

		
		Responsive Capabilities
		
			Containment
						- Coordinated Shutdown
						- Wipe and Rebuild
						
			Eradication		
						- Once you have identified domains or IP addresses leveraged by the malicious actors for command and control,
						The IR team should remove the known existing threats from the networks.
			
			Recovery
					   - Develop a near-term remediation strategy and roadmap
						 Focus on resuming normal business operations
						 Develop a long-term risk mitigation strategy
						 Document the incident to improve the IR plan and update security measures to avoid such incidents in future
						 
			
		
 #> Cybersecurity Threat is a malicious act that seeks to damage data.. steal data or disrupt digital life in general. 
	
	10 Most Common Types of Cyber Threats
	
		+ Malware (spyware, ransomware, viruses and worms)
		+ Phishing
		+ Spear Phishing
		+ MitM attack
		+ Trojans
		+ Ransomware
		+ DDoS
		+ Attacks on IoT Devices
		+ Data Breaches		
		
		
 #> Level of Attacks
 
		+ Application (GET Flood, Slow POST, Slowloris, SQL Injection, )
		+ Transport (SYN Flood, UDP Flood, DNS Query Flood, LAND Attack)
		+ Network (IP Spoofing, Brute Force, Botnet, MiTM)
		+ Data Link (Generating Forged Frame, Repeated Frame Header Flood)
		+ Physical (Signal Jamming)
		
		
 #> Indicator of compromise (IoC) is an object or activity that indicates 
		high probability of unauthorized access to the system
 
	List of indicators of compromise (IOCs) examples

		+ Unusual Outbound Network Traffic
		+ Anomalies in Privileged User Account Activity
		+ Geographic Irregularities
		+ Log-In Anomalies
		+ Increased Volume in Database Read
		+ HTML Response Size
		+ A Large Number of Requests for the Same File
		+ Mismatched Port-Application Traffic
		+ Suspicious Registry
		+ DNS Request Anomalies
		
		
		
 #> Reasons to Store and Analyze Centralized Logs
 
		+ Centralized logs are indispensable to troubleshooting
		+ Centralized logs help you proactively manage your network
		+ Centralized logs help you deliver greater value
		+ Centralized logs reduce the risk of losing data
		+ Centralized logs improve your network security
		
		
		
	
 #> Hacking Methodology
		+ Reconnaissance 
		  Types of Reconnaissance (Active Reconnaissance | Passive Reconnaissance)
			- Information Gathering
			- Determining the network range 
			- Identifying the active machine
			- Finding open ports and access points

 #> Incident Detection with SIEM
 
		+ Application Level Incident Detection
		+ Network Level Incident Detection
		+ Host Level Incident Detection
		+ Compliance
		+ Handling Alert Triaging and Analysis
		
		
 #> Incident Detection with Threat Intelligence

		+ Threat intelligence  is information an organization uses to understand the 
	threats that have.. will or are currently targeting the organization. This info is 
	used to prepare.. prevent and identify cyber threats looking to take advantage of valuable resources..

	Four main types of threat intelligence are strategic ..  tactical..  technical and operational
