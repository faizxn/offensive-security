

	#### footprint and reconnaissanc #### extract information about the target organization that includes
		
				- organization information (employee details, partner details, webtechnologies)
				- network information	(domain, subdomain, network block, network toplologies, router and firewall, whois and dns record)
				- system information (operating system, web server)

		footprint refers to process of collecting information about target network and its enviroment. 
		
			it can be categorized into two
				- passive footprint (involves information without direct interaction)
				- active footprint (involves information direct interaction)
	
			perform footprint using search engines
				- gather information using advanced google search, video, ftp, iot search engines techniques

			perform footprint using web services
				- find company domain and sub-domain using netcraft
				- gathering personal information using people online search
				- gathering email list using theharvester
				- gathering information using deep and dark web searching 
				- determine target os using passive footprinting 
				
			perform footprint using social networking site
				- gathering employee information from linkedin using theharvester
				- gathering personal information from various social netoworking site using sherlock
				- gathering information using followerwonk 
				
			perform website footprinting
				- gather information about a target website using ping command
				- gather information about a target website using website informer
				- extract company data using web data extrator 
				- mirror a target website using httrack website copier
				- gather a wordlist from target website using cewl
				
			perform email footprint
				- gathering information about a target by tracing email using emailtrackerpro

			perform whois footprint
				- whois lookup using domaintools
				
			perform dns footprint
				- gather dns information using nslookup and online tools
				- perform reverse dns lookup using reverse ip domain check and dnsrecon
					
			perform network footprinting


	#### vulnerability analysis #### vulnerability assesment scan network for known security weakness. 
			
		+ objectives
				- network vulnerabilities
				- tcp/udp prts and services that are listening 
				- application and services configuration errors and vulnerabilities
				- os version running on computer or devices
				- application install on computer
				- accounts with weak passwords
				- files and folders with weak permission
				- default services and application that may have to be uninstalled
				- mistakes in security configuration of common application
				- computer exposed to known or publicly reported vulnerabilities
					
	VA plays a major role in providing security to organization resources and infrastructure from various internal
				and external threats.  To secure, administrator needs to perform path management.. install proper antivirus..check 
				configuration and solve known issues in third-party applications with default configuration.

	#### system hacking #### is the process of testin computer system and software for security vulnerability.
			there are four steps in the system hacking
					1. gaining access
					2. escalation priviledge
					3. maintain access
					4. clearing logs			
			
		+ https://github.com/SpiderLabs/Responder     // same network windows spying
		+ L0phtCrack 									// is a password auditing and recovery application.also used to test password strength	
		+ Ophcrack
		+ metasploit		
					use exploit/multi/handler, set payload windows/meterpreter/reverse_tcp, exploit
					
		+ armitage 
		+ immunity debugger								// check youtube 
		+ Snow  Steganography 
		+ openstego Steganography
	
	
	#### malware threats#### malicious software that disable and damage computer system 
						which includes virus.. trojan.. rootkits.. adware.. keylogger and ransomeware

		+ njrat rat trojan 
		+ hide trojan using swayscryptor and make it undetecable to antivirus program
		+ prorat 
		+ theef rat
		+ jps virus maker
		
		+ malware analysis- (static)
				virustotal.. bintext.. peid.. pe explorer.. dependency walker.. ida and ollydbg
				
		+ malware analysis- (dynamic)			
				 tcpview..  process monitor.. regshot.. softperfect network scanner.. jv16 powertools..autorun
				


	#### sql injection ####  authentication bypass, authorization bypass, information disclouse, remote code execution
	
		+ thre are theree types of sql injection

			1. in-band sql injection (attacker uses same communications channel to perform the attack)
			2. blind sql injection (an attacker has no error message from the system)
			3. out-band sql injection (attacker uses different communications channel to perform the attack)
				
		+ perform sql injection attacks
			- perform an sql injection attack on mssql database
			- perform an sql injection attack on mssql database to exact database using mssql
			
		+ detect sql injection vulnerability using tools
			- detect sql injection vulnerability using dsss
			- detect sql injection vulnerability using owasp zap


			


	#### hacking wireless networks #### 
		


	#### hacking mobile platform #### 

			+ hack android devices 
				- hack an android device by creating binay payloads using parrot security
				- harvest users credential using social engineer toolkit
				- launch dos attack on target machine using loic (low orbit cannon)
				- exploit the android platform through adb using phonesploit
				
			+ secure android devices using various android security tools 
				- analyse a malicious app using online android analyzer
				- analyse a malicious app using quixxi vulnerability scanner
				- secure android devices from malicious app using malwarebytes security


	#### iot and ot hacking #### 
	
			+ performing iot and ot device footprinting. various phases of iot and ot device hacking
				- google dork
				- shodan
						
			+ capturing and analyzing traffic between iot devices

	#### cloud computing #### delivers various types of services and application over the internet.
	
		+ performing S3 bucket enumeration
			- lazys3
			- s3scanner
			
		+ exploiting misconfiguation S3 bucket
			- aws cli
			
		+ escalating privileges of a target IAM user by exploiting misconfiguation
		

		

	#### cryptography #### is the techniques of secure communications between sender and receiver. data is encrypted using a secret key. 
	
	there are two types of cryptography
	
			- symmetric encryption (secret-key, shared-key and private-key) uses same key for encryption and decryption.
			- asymmetric encryption (public-key) uses different key for encryption and decryption. known as public and private.
		
	
		+ encrypt the information using cryptography tools
			- hashcalc
			- md5 calculator
			- advanced encryption package
			- bctextencoder 

		+ create self sign certificate
		+ perform email encryption

		+ perform disk encryption
			- veracrypt
			- bitlocker drive encryption
			- rohos disk encryption
