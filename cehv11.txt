				- organization information (employee details, partner details, webtechnologies)
				- network information	(domain, subdomain, network block, network toplologies, router and firewall, whois and dns record)
				- system information (operating system, web server)

		footprint refers to process of collecting information about target network and its enviroment. 
		
			it can be categorized into two
				- passive footprint (involves information without direct interaction)
				- active footprint (involves information direct interaction)
	
			perform footprint using search engines
				- gather information using advanced google search, video, ftp, iot search engines techniques

			perform footprint using web services
				- find company domain and sub-domain using netcraft
				- gathering personal information using people online search
				- gathering email list using theharvester
				- gathering information using deep and dark web searching 
				- determine target os using passive footprinting 
				
			perform footprint using social networking site
				- gathering employee information from linkedin using theharvester
				- gathering personal information from various social netoworking site using sherlock
				- gathering information using followerwonk 
				
			perform website footprinting
				- gather information about a target website using ping command
				- gather information about a target website using website informer
				- extract company data using web data extrator 
				- mirror a target website using httrack website copier
				- gather a wordlist from target website using cewl
				
			perform email footprint
				- gathering information about a target by tracing email using emailtrackerpro

			perform whois footprint
				- whois lookup using domaintools
				
		perform dns footprint
			- gather dns information using nslookup and online tools
			- perform reverse dns lookup using reverse ip domain check and dnsrecon
					
		perform network footprinting



	#### sql injection ####  authentication bypass, authorization bypass, information disclouse, remote code execution
	
		+ thre are theree types of sql injection

			1. in-band sql injection (attacker uses same communications channel to perform the attack)
			2. blind sql injection (an attacker has no error message from the system)
			3. out-band sql injection (attacker uses different communications channel to perform the attack)
				
		+ perform sql injection attacks
			- perform an sql injection attack on mssql database
			- perform an sql injection attack on mssql database to exact database using mssql
			
		+ detect sql injection vulnerability using tools
			- detect sql injection vulnerability using dsss
			- detect sql injection vulnerability using owasp zap


			


	#### hacking wireless networks #### 
		


	#### hacking mobile platform #### 

			+ hack android devices 
				- hack an android device by creating binay payloads using parrot security
				- harvest users credential using social engineer toolkit
				- launch dos attack on target machine using loic (low orbit cannon)
				- exploit the android platform through adb using phonesploit
				
			+ secure android devices using various android security tools 
				- analyse a malicious app using online android analyzer
				- analyse a malicious app using quixxi vulnerability scanner
				- secure android devices from malicious app using malwarebytes security


	#### iot and ot hacking #### 
	
			+ performing iot and ot device footprinting. various phases of iot and ot device hacking
				- google dork
				- shodan
						
			+ capturing and analyzing traffic between iot devices
				- mqtt explorer
			
			

	#### cloud computing #### delivers various types of services and application over the internet.
	
		+ performing S3 bucket enumeration
			- lazys3
			- s3scanner
			
		+ exploiting misconfiguation S3 bucket
			- aws cli
			
		+ escalating privileges of a target IAM user by exploiting misconfiguation
		

		

	#### cryptography #### is the techniques of secure communications between sender and receiver. data is encrypted using a secret key. 
	
	there are two types of cryptography
	
			- symmetric encryption (secret-key, shared-key and private-key) uses same key for encryption and decryption.
			- asymmetric encryption (public-key) uses different key for encryption and decryption. known as public and private.
		
	
		+ encrypt the information using cryptography tools
			- hashcalc
			- md5 calculator
			- advanced encryption package
			- bctextencoder 

		+ create self sign certificate
		+ perform email encryption

		+ perform disk encryption
			- veracrypt
			- bitlocker drive encryption
			- rohos disk encryption

		+ perform cryptanlysis using cryptanlysis tools - is a process of finding weaknesses in cryptographic algorithms
			- cryptool
			- alphapeeler
