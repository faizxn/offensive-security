@Encoding is for maintaining data usability and can be reversed 
			by employing the same algorithm that encoded the content, i.e. no key is used.

		(HTML Encoding, URL Encoding, Unicode Encoding, Base64 Encoding Hex Encoding, ASCII Encoding)
	

@Encryption is for maintaining data confidentiality and requires
			the use of a key (kept secret) in order to return to plaintext..

				
		i.e  - Caesar Shift Cipher.. each letter of the alphabet is shifted some fixed number.. The shift is named a “ROT" as rotation..   
	
@Hashing is for validating the integrity of content by detecting 
			all modification thereof via obvious changes to the hash output.
	

@Obfuscation is used to prevent people from understanding the meaning
			of something and is often used with computer code to help prevent successful
			reverse engineering and/or theft of a product’s functionality.
