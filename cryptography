@cia triad:
  + confidentiality - make sure data is kept secret or private and prevent the unauthorized sharing of data.. 
  + integrity 		- making sure your data is trustworthy and free from tampering..
  + availability  	- can be accessed by authenticated users whenever they are needed..
  
  

@osi security arhitecture:

	+security attak	- action that compromises the security..
	
		+ passive attack  	: dont affect system resources.. monitoring/reads of transmission.. 
		+ active attack	    : involve some modification of the data stream or creation of fake stream..
									- masquerade
									- reply
									- modification of sms
									- dos
		
	+security mechanism	- detect prevent and recover from security attack..
  
						(specific security mechanism)

@model for network security

	+ desing an algorithm
	+ generate the secret information 
	+ develop methods for distribution and sharing of information
	+ specify a protocol
