
 # fuzzing is a software testing technique of putting invalid or random data called FUZZ into software system
 	to discover coding errors and security loopholes.

	- fuzzy testing finds the most serious security fault or defect and vulnerability.


 # how to do Fuzz testing?	
	the steps for fuzzy testing include the basic testing steps-
		- dentify the target system
		- identify inputs
		- generate fuzzed data
		- execute the test using fuzzy data
		- monitor system behavior
		- log defects


 # examples of fuzzers
    		- mutation-based fuzzer
		- generation-based fuzzer
		- protocol-based fuzzer


 # types of bugs detected by fuzz-testing
		- assertion failures and memory leaks
		- invalid input
		- correctness bugs

 # fuzz testing tools
		- peach fuzzer
		- spike proxy
		- webscarab
		- OWASP WSfuzzer
